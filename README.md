<h2>How to run this:</h2>
Refer the dataset.
understand the data attributes.
Goto google collab, there you can see the code for this project.
Each cell canbe run on that cell itself and can get the output instantaneously.
At the end of the collab, you can find the input label.
As you give your input values the prediction system may predict the result.
